	- Investigating the computational principles underlying multiple view geometry and statistics, and she has discovered a number of basic computational principles in the analysis of visual motion and shape recovery. These include view-invariant texture descriptors, constraints on 3-D motion estimation, 3-D shape and image segmentation, insights on the effects of sensor design on motion estimation, and the findings of statistical bias in low-level processing.
