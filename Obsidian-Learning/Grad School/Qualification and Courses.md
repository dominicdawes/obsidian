1. Ensure that the Qualifying Courses cover at least four different areas. Courses that are eligible for two areas will have only one count towards degree requirements. Whichever area the student has not yet taken as part of a breadth requirement will be used by default.

In addition, students must:
4. Enroll in the Ph.D. seminar course “How to Conduct Great Research” (CMSC800) 
5. Complete two additional “Elective” graduate courses (600-800 level), which can be outside the department and do not necessarily need to be qualifying courses, but must be completed with a grade of B- or higher

>***What Counts as Qualifying***
>	- Qualifying Course Designation is provided by the graduate office.
>	- For a course to be considered as qualifying, its grading must be primarily based (at least 75%) on a combination of homework, programming assignments, research projects, and exams. 
>	- Among these, ***written exams must constitute ≥ 30% of the overall grade***.


#### Preliminary Examination and Advancing to Candidacy

**Qualification Exam** Must be taken after completing coursework and before the end of the 4th year of your admission to the program

**Proposal Defense**
* an oral examination to review your preparation to conduct your proposed dissertation research and your plan of research
* mastery over both fundamental concepts and the research literature in three areas related to your research are also examined
	* done via a “reading list” with about 10 publications (fundamental texts or research papers) in each of these areas.

**Written Proposal Document and Oral Exam Details**
The oral examination typically spans two hours and encompasses the following segments:
- Presentation of the dissertation proposal (about 30-45 minutes)
* Questions & discussion of the proposal in an open forum
* Questions and discussion of the proposal in a closed setting with the committee
* An examination based on the reading list (~30 papers, 10 papers per research area)
* During this examination, you will be expected to demonstrate a level of competence that is necessary to complete the research plan.
Subsequent to the examination, candidates will be asked to step out while the committee deliberates. 

#### Concentration Areas
There are currently eight areas:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Bioinformatics
- Computer Systems
- Database Systems
- Software Engineering/Programming Languages/HCI
- Scientific Computing
- Algorithms and Computation Theory
- Visual and Geometric Computing
