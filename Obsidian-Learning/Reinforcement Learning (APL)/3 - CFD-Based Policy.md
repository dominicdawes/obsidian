Figure represented various types of risl profiles

### Optimistic vs Pessimistic Agent Risk Profiles
Pessimistic
* Upweights parts where it struggle
* Maintained high entropy (in the gradient ascent search)
Optimistic
* Upweights parts where it succeeds
* Does not look at its deficiencies
* Maintained high entropy (in the gradient ascent search)
