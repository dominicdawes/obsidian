**Overview**
 * DINO, a transformer-based detection method, **offers state-of-the-art object detection performance** and end-to-end optimization, eliminating the need for handcrafted modules like NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression).
* DINO is a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model that represents learned features as rich feature vectors maps. In the case of DinoV2 its of shape(batch_size, 256, 384)
