### What is UMAP?

Dimensional technique reduction that uses n-neighbor distance, topology simplices/directed graphs, fuzzy probability, and manifold theory to represent high dimensional data (aka high feature/category) in to lower dimensional space while preserving both local and global features.

### Understanding UMAP Parameters

`n_neighbors`
* The most important parameter is `n_neighbors` - the number of approximate nearest neighbors used to construct the initial high-dimensional graph. It effectively controls how UMAP balances local versus global structure:

	- low values will push UMAP to focus more on local structure by constraining the number of neighboring points considered when analyzing the data in high dimensions
	
	- high values will push UMAP towards representing the big-picture structure while losing fine detail.

`min_dist`
* The second parameterÂ min_dist, or the minimum distance between points in low-dimensional space. This parameter controls how tightly UMAP clumps points together
