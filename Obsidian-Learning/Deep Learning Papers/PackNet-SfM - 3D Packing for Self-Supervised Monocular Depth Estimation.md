| What They Did?                                                                                                                                                                | What was the result?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| A novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation method combining geometry with a new deep network, PackNet                                                                 | The 3D inductive bias in PackNet enables it to scale with input resolution and number of parameters without overfitting, generalizing better on out-of-domain data such as the NuScenes dataset                                                          |

| Our architecture leverages novel symmetrical packing and unpacking blocks to jointly learn to compress and decompress detail-preserving representations using 3D convolutions | content..<br><br>also... they released DDAD (Dense Depth for Automated Driving), a new urban driving dataset with more challenging and accurate depth evaluation, thanks to longer-range and denser ground-truth depth generated from high-density LiDAR |
