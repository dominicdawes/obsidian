### What is PX4?

PX4 is powerful open source autopilot flight stack running on the NuttX RTOS.

Key features include:
- Support for many different vehicle frames/types (multi-copters, vtol, ground vehicles).
- Great choice of drone components for flight controller, sensors, payloads, and other peripherals.
- Flexible and powerful flight modes and safety features.
- Robust and deep integration with companion computers and robotics APIs such as ROS 2 and MAVSDK).

PX4 is a core part of a broader drone platform that includes the QGroundControl ground station, Pixhawk hardware, and MAVSDK for integration with companion computers, cameras and other hardware using the MAVLink protocol. PX4 is supported by the Dronecode Project.

### What is the Flight Controller (FC)?\

The flight controller is the hardware (e.g. the CubePilot) that the PX4 firmware and flight control algorithms reside.
